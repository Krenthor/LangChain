Just the sort of people Villane is in need of.At this point, all the Players have their Character Sheets, and you're ready to start playing. Read this next part aloud:Dusk falls, and several travelers come to the Green Dragon Inn for food, warmth, and a place to rest.

It's good for everyone to get an idea of who they are and who their party is made up of; it will help you all get a bit more immersed in the story.\n",
        "            3. Lars: While Matt is off fixing whatever the PCs have ordered, and the characters have had a chance to get to know each other and the NPCs, something has to happen...A large man, wearing a black leather apron over a linen shirt and woolen pants, bursts in the door. He smells of sulfur and carries a heavy hammer.\"They got Bess,\" he says, \"they got my girl!\" Goblins have kidnapped the Blacksmith's daughter! That's right, the second key NPC, Lars, The Blacksmith. The villagers all know Lars, he's well-loved, but none of them are equipped to face the challenge of hunting down goblins. Lars will recognize a band of ratcatchers as quickly as anyone, and he won't hesitate to approach the adventurers to ask for their help. If your players aren't motivated, simply by their sense of justice and duty, you can have Lars point out that there is a standing bounty for goblin ears by order of the Duke. Now is a good time to remind you, one of your best moves as a Dungeon Master is to simply ask the players, \"What do you do?\" — this is a great opportunity to use that move! Once Lars has convinced the adventurers to help, you can continue on to the smithy\n",
        "            4. Smithy: Lars doesn't know where the goblins took his daughter, but he's confident that a competent adventurer can find tracks in the area around his house. While Lars can offer this information to the players if they seem to be feeling stuck, you should give them the chance to propose searching the crime scene on their own. You can simply narrate the journey from the Green Dragon Inn to Lars' Smithy, describing the dirt road and the trees that dot the path. Once you arrive at the Smithy, use your classic DM move and ask the players, \"What do you do?\". You can even have Lars nudge them and ask, \"do you see any tracks?\".\n",

A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check recognizes that at least two goblins dragged something north, into the forest. \"The Boar Wood,\" Lars notes.  Ability Checks:When you ask a player to make an ability check, they roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. In the above instance, a character searching for tracks would roll a Wisdom (Survival) check set to a Difficulty Class of your choosing. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success—the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it’s a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the DM.

Take a moment to describe what he looks like, how he moves, what he's doing as he approaches.Now would be a great time for you to ask the Players to describe their Characters. It's good for everyone to get an idea of who they are and who their party is made up of; it will help you all get a bit more immersed in the story.\",\n",

He smells of sulfur and carries a heavy hammer.They got Bess, he says, they got my girl! Goblins have kidnapped the Blacksmith's daughter! That's right, the second key NPC, Lars, The Blacksmith. The villagers all know Lars, he's well-loved, but none of them are equipped to face the challenge of hunting down goblins. Lars will recognize a band of ratcatchers as quickly as anyone, and he won't hesitate to approach the adventurers to ask for their help. If your players aren't motivated, simply by their sense of justice and duty, you can have Lars point out that there is a standing bounty for goblin ears by order of the Duke 10g each. Now is a good time to remind you, one of your best moves as a Dungeon Master is to simply ask the players,  — this is a great opportunity to use that move! Once Lars has convinced the adventurers to help, you can continue on to the smithy\",\n",

While Lars can offer this information to the players if they seem to be feeling stuck, you should give them the chance to propose searching the crime scene on their own. You can simply narrate the journey from the Green Dragon Inn to Lars' Smithy, describing the dirt road and the trees that dot the path. Once you arrive at the Smithy, use your classic DM move and ask the players, What do you do?. You can even have Lars nudge them and ask, do you see any tracks?.\",\n",
        "'5': \"Tracks : The tracks are plentiful, and easy to spot. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check recognizes that at least two goblins dragged something north, into the forest. The Boar Wood, Lars notes.  Ability Checks:When you ask a player to make an ability check, they roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. In the above instance, a character searching for tracks would roll a Wisdom (Survival) check set to a Difficulty Class of your choosing. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success—the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it’s a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the DM. Remember these common DCs as a rule of thumb; you can choose any number for your challenge: Difficulty | DC Easy 10 Moderate 15 Hard 20\",\n",
